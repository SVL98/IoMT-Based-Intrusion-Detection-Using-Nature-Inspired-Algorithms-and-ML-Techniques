The rapid adoption of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has transformed modern healthcare by enabling continuous patient monitoring, remote diagnosis, and real-time data exchange among medical devices. However, the resource-constrained nature of IoMT devices and their exposure to heterogeneous networks make them highly vulnerable to cyberattacks, such as denial-of-service (DoS), data injection, spoofing, and reconnaissance attacks. Traditional security mechanisms are often inadequate to handle the scale, complexity, and dynamic behavior of IoMT environments, necessitating intelligent and adaptive intrusion detection solutions.

This project proposes an IoMT-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that leverages Nature-Inspired Algorithms (NIA) combined with Machine Learning (ML) techniques to achieve robust, accurate, and efficient attack detection. Nature-inspired optimization algorithms—such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Cuckoo Search, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), or Firefly Algorithm—are employed to perform feature selection and optimization, reducing data dimensionality while preserving the most discriminative features for intrusion detection.
